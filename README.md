# Credit-score-assessment-criteria

This project gives credit score based on previous available data on people who were issued credit card and if they defaulted or not and thier profit margins.
This project uses their data like income, credit card debt, automobile debt, age etc to assign score and a particular threshold of score above which credit card request is accepted otherwise declined.

Some important points.
AUC score = how good your model satisfies data points. Overall fitting.
Threshold value will be taken as threshold at minimum CPE(cost per event) in training data.
